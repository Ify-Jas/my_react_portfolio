# My React Portfolio

 ## Description
  This project was about utilising all we've learnt so far in React using Node.js, ES6 and more recently JSX. The project was very challenging but very exciting at the same time to see what can be done with React.

  I was able to navigate some difficulties in loading a page with image on React github, I was also able to utilise my knowledge of Object orientated programming in setting up my JSON data and also the components.

  ## Installation
  The user will need to download Node.js and React onto their system, then run NPM start to start compiling, NPM run build to build webpage.

  If the user already has this, then all that is needed is a git clone and run in the command line by calling npm start.


  
  ## Usage
  Navigate to all the pages using the Nav bar.
  To download, git clone.
  Nodejs and React needs to be downloaded.
